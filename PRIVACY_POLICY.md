We recommend reviewing [Google's AI Services Privacy Policy](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms) for more details.

Your screenshots and extracted data are securely stored on Cloudflare's infrastructure. We use industry-standard encryption protocols to protect your data during transmission and storage.

### 4.2. Data Retention
We retain your personal information and content only for as long as necessary to provide the Service to you. You can request the deletion of your account and all associated data at any time.

### 4.3. International Data Transfers
